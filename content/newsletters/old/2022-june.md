2. **Meet and Greet**: Our annual summer meet and greet was a hit! We enjoyed the potluck dishes and the company of our neighbors.

3. **Gardening Workshop**: The gardening workshop provided insights into summer planting and sustainable gardening techniques.

**Reminders**:

Thanks for being a part of our wonderful community!

Best,
