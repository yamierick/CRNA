# Carter Riverside Neighborhood Association: December 2023 Notes


Carter Riverside Neighborhood Association had its monthly meeting and annual Christmas Social on December 14. Special guests included Councilwoman Jeanette Martinez, District 11 Director Rachel Arellano and Riverside Lions Club president Jose Suarez. Riverside Business Spotlight was Texas Boot Restoration and owner Erik Reyes and CRNA Member Spotlight was Jerry Strother. CRNA members donated almost $1000 to the Carter Riverside High Angel Tree program and provided gifts and home essentials for a single parent family of six. Way to go CRNA!

We also had our Christmas event that over 100 kids went to!
